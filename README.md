## Instagram Downloader App
=========

### About
An application that downloads the most recent 20 images of a user's instagram profile.

### Tools used

1. Python
2. Instagram API

### Goals for this project

1. Develop a greater understanding of the Python language
2. Practice using various Python modules and libraries
3. Gain experience using Python's web services and libraries
4. Practice working with JSON data and using Python to interpret it
5. Research and understand Instagram's API and work with API's in general.

### Process

The idea for this project was to create an application where a user could download all of their photos uploaded to their account on Instagram. All they would have to do is simply run the application and all of their photos would be downloaded into a directory named "Photos". However, after looking at Instagram's API, I quickly found out that all applications are first entered into "Sandbox Mode" where users only have access to their 20 most recent images. I was fairly disappointed in this as I wasn't able to complete my goal, but it turned out to be a fun project in the end.

### Lessons learned

1. Reviewed the process of opening, reading, and working with files.
2. How to interact with the file system with Python's os module such as creating directories, checking for existing directories, and looking at files.
3. How to make HTTP get requests with Python's request module.
4. How to load JSON with Python and gather specific data stored in the JSON response.
5. How to retrieve data from the web.

### Extensions for the future

1. Take the application to the next step and apply to go Live and have full access to Instagram content.
2. Automate the script where an image is immediately downloaded once the user posts again.
